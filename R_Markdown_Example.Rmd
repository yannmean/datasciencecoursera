```{r}
library (knitr)
library (ggplot2)

```

Create the dataframe contains 1000 simulation, each with 40 rexp generated 

```{r}
sim <- 1000
n <- 40
lambda <- 0.2
simdata <- matrix(rexp(sim*n, rate = lambda), sim)
```

Calculate sample mean and theoretical mean.

```{r}
sample_mean <- apply(simdata, 1, mean)
cal_sample_mean <- mean(sample_mean)
theo_mean <- 1/lambda
theo_sd <- (1/lambda)/(1/sqrt(n))
```
